def train_neural_net(model, loss_fn, X, y,
                     n_replicates=3, max_iter = 10000, tolerance=1e-6):
    """
    Train a neural network with PyTorch based on a training set consisting of
    observations X and class y. The model and loss_fn inputs define the
    architecture to train and the cost-function update the weights based on,
    respectively.
    
    Usage:
        Assuming loaded dataset (X,y) has been split into a training and 
        test set called (X_train, y_train) and (X_test, y_test), and
        that the dataset has been cast into PyTorch tensors using e.g.:
            X_train = torch.tensor(X_train, dtype=torch.float)
        Here illustrating a binary classification example based on e.g.
        M=2 features with H=2 hidden units:
    
        >>> # Define the overall architechture to use
        >>> model = lambda: torch.nn.Sequential( 
                    torch.nn.Linear(M, H),  # M features to H hiden units
                    torch.nn.Tanh(),        # 1st transfer function
                    torch.nn.Linear(H, 1),  # H hidden units to 1 output neuron
                    torch.nn.Sigmoid()      # final tranfer function
                    ) 
        >>> loss_fn = torch.nn.BCELoss() # define loss to use
        >>> net, final_loss, learning_curve = train_neural_net(model,
                                                       loss_fn,
                                                       X=X_train,
                                                       y=y_train,
                                                       n_replicates=3)
        >>> y_test_est = net(X_test) # predictions of network on test set
        >>> # To optain "hard" class predictions, threshold the y_test_est
        >>> See exercise ex8_2_2.py for indepth example.
        
        For multi-class with C classes, we need to change this model to e.g.:
        >>> model = lambda: torch.nn.Sequential(
                            torch.nn.Linear(M, H), #M features to H hiden units
                            torch.nn.ReLU(), # 1st transfer function
                            torch.nn.Linear(H, C), # H hidden units to C classes
                            torch.nn.Softmax(dim=1) # final tranfer function
                            )
        >>> loss_fn = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
        
        And the final class prediction is based on the argmax of the output
        nodes:
        >>> y_class = torch.max(y_test_est, dim=1)[1]
        
    Args:
        model:          A function handle to make a torch.nn.Sequential.
        loss_fn:        A torch.nn-loss, e.g.  torch.nn.BCELoss() for binary 
                        binary classification, torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss() for
                        multiclass classification, or torch.nn.MSELoss() for
                        regression (see https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#loss-functions)
        n_replicates:   An integer specifying number of replicates to train,
                        the neural network with the lowest loss is returned.
        max_iter:       An integer specifying the maximum number of iterations
                        to do (default 10000).
        tolerenace:     A float describing the tolerance/convergence criterion
                        for minimum relative change in loss (default 1e-6)
                        
        
    Returns:
        A list of three elements:

                            loss of the trained replicates
            final_loss:     An float specifying the loss of best performing net
            learning_curve: A list containing the learning curve of the best net.
